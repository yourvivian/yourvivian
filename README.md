I'm a CS junior passionate about building software. I'm always looking to level up my skills through internships, fellowships, and open-source contributions. Down the road, I want to lead tech products that transform lives.
- ðŸŒ± Previously, I built a mobile app to transform group travelling, [Tourific](https://github.com/trihoang0809/tourific). Currently, I'm working on expanding a card game (Love Letters) and contributing to a Chrome extension for LeetCode (launch this summer!).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for contributing in open-source projects and join tech fellowships.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about self-studying and interview prep!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I self-studied coding for a year (my previous college didnâ€™t have CS) and landed internships in tech. I believe in *making it happen*!
