I'm a International Studies major with a special interest in technology. My widest dream is to become an accomplished tech entrepreneur and writer. But let's go with the flow for the time being.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development and UX design.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on... anything, really.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about web development, social entrepreneurship, applied technology (and Harry Potter).
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her/hers.
- âš¡ Fun fact: As I set my LinkedIn intro as "aspiring tech entrepreneur" (tho without a slightest idea of how to get there), cool tech gurus reach out to me. Let's see where I am after 10 years.
